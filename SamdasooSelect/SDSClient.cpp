		* WSAEINTR: The (blocking) call was canceled through WSACancelBlockingCall.
		* WSAEINPROGRESS: A blocking Windows Sockets 1.1 call is in progress, or the service provider is still processing a callback function.
		* WSAENETRESET: For a connection-oriented socket, this error indicates that the connection has been broken due to keep-alive activity that detected a failure while the operation was in progress. For a datagram socket, this error indicates that the time to live has expired.
		* WSAENOTSOCK: The descriptor is not a socket.
		* WSAEOPNOTSUPP: MSG_OOB was specified, but the socket is not stream-style such as type SOCK_STREAM, OOB data is not supported in the communication domain associated with this socket, or the socket is unidirectional and supports only send operations.
		* WSAESHUTDOWN: The socket has been shut down; it is not possible to receive on a socket after shutdown has been invoked with how set to SD_RECEIVE or SD_BOTH.
		* WSAEWOULDBLOCK: The socket is marked as nonblocking and the receive operation would block.
		* WSAEMSGSIZE: The message was too large to fit into the specified buffer and was truncated.
		* WSAEINVAL: The socket has not been bound with bind, or an unknown flag was specified, or MSG_OOB was specified for a socket with SO_OOBINLINE enabled or (for byte stream sockets only) len was zero or negative.
		* WSAECONNABORTED: The virtual circuit was terminated due to a time-out or other failure. The application should close the socket as it is no longer usable.
		* WSAETIMEDOUT: The connection has been dropped because of a network failure or because the peer system failed to respond.
		* WSAECONNRESET: The virtual circuit was reset by the remote side executing a hard or abortive close. The application should close the socket as it is no longer usable. On a UDP-datagram socket, this error would indicate that a previous send operation resulted in an ICMP "Port Unreachable" message.
